# Data structures

In this repository I've implemented basic data structures in C:
* Linked list: singly, doubly (linear and circular) - in progress
* Stack - TBI
* Queue - TBI
* Hash map - TBI
* Binary trees - TBI
* Graph - TBI

Note: TBI = To Be Implemented

## Purpose

This project was created in order to learn and implement data structures as well as familiarizing with the C language.

I intend to use and optimize them for my future projects.
