# Data structures

In this repository I've implemented basic data structures in C:
* Linked list: singly, doubly (linear and circular)
* Stack
* Queue
* Hash map
* Binary trees
* Graph

## Purpose

This project was created in order to learn and implement data structures as well as familiarizing with the C language.

I intend to use and optimize them for my future projects.
